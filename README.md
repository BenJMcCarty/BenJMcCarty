# 📚 Storyteller-Turned-Scientist 🔬

Hello! I'm Ben, a storyteller-turned-scientist at the intersection of data, systems, and people.

My background is in telling stories:
* 🛶 Helping my family run whitewater rafting tours
* 📚 Finding books as a librarian
* 🛌 Over the past six years, creating memorable guest experiences as a hotelier
 
Along every step of my journey, the stories I created and told entertained, educated, and inspired people. 

**Now, I turn my story-telling talents to a new career focused on telling the stories hidden in data.**

## What I Do

I have a passion for learning and leveraging data and systems for insights and decision-making.

* Obtaining and cleaning data 
* Creating visualizations to see and share the stories
* Developing and training machine learning models to understand the *whys* and *hows* behind the data
* Suggesting improvements and changes to adapt to the stories hidden in the data
